## 2to3 and six libraries

The [2to3 library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/2to3.html#:~:text=2to3%20is%20a%20Python%20program,will%20handle%20almost%20all%20code._) is designed to help transform python 2 code into python 3 compatible code. The [six library](https://pypi.org/project/six/) lets you import functions that work in both python 2 and 3, and it handles the compatibility between both.

### Steps for working through python 2/3 conflicts

1. find each conflict in a repository using 2to3
2. if py3 replacement works in py2, overwrite the code to py3 version
3. Else, overwrite to the `six` version which is compatible in both py2 and py3
4. transition to py3 for your project
5. overwrite the `six` verions you added in step 3 to py3 versions

Example of a 2to3 fixer you can run to transition python 2 `assert` statements to their equivatent in python 3: https://docs.python.org/3/library/2to3.html#2to3fixer-asserts

## functools.partial

functools.partial() allows you take a multiparam function and prefill some params, effectively creating another function with fewer params. So let's say you have a function `f1(x,y,z)` by doing `f2 = functools.partial(f1, 1, 2)` you are creating a function for which `f1(1,2,3)` and `f2(3)` are equivalent.

```python
In [1]: import functools

In [2]: def f1(x, y, z):
   ...:     print(x, y, z)
   ...:

In [3]: f2 = functools.partial(f1, 1, 2)

In [4]: f1(1, 2, 3)
1 2 3

In [6]: f2(3)
1 2 3
```

## static methods

- do not use staticmethod in a class if you can make it a module function
- do not use module function if you can just use inner body function multiple times in less lines of code

## Notes on data tools

- Apache
	- Hadoop = batch processing, FOSS implementation of MapReduce (Java)
	- Storm = realtime stream processing (Clojure)
	- Cassandra = distributed NoSQL database, wide column store (key/val + tabular)
	- Kafka = realtime stream processing (Scala and Java)
- [Video covering Apache Storm, and Apache Hadoop, Apache Kafka](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7SzI0vQL-E)
	- "Big data" 3 V's
		- Velocity (24/7 and read/write often)
		- Variety (data types and structured/unstruct)
		- Volume (tera-, peta-, exa-, zetta-, yotta- bytes). Grande.
- Hadoop
	- distrib. storage, processing, clusters of hardward, 1000s of machines, parallelization. HDFS (replication of blocks) and MapReduce (parallel processing - Master/Worker nodes, Jobs, Mappers, Reducers, Tasks).
	- In Soviet Russia Hadoop, processes are sent to where data is stored.
		- I don't remember why I wrote this but it was funny at the time.
	- fault toleranace
- Storm
	- realtime (not batch)
	- processes streams of data
	- Storm takes care of queues! i.e. if data is piling up on one Bolt
	- Java, Closure, and Python

##  ETag headers explained with üçî and üå≠

![Etag headers](/images/etag_header.png)

1. Customer orders "the special"
2. Server serves üçî with e-tag ID 1
3. Customer orders "the special" again with "if-none-match" etag 1 (I only want new special, satisfied with having üçî)
4. Server says e-tag same "304 not modified", still üçî
5. Customer says cool I already have that NVM
6. Later, customer orders "the special"
7. Server says e-tag no longer 1, it's ABC
8. Server serves new "special" which is now üå≠

Problem: e-tags are generated per server (I.e. by Apache). If reverse proxy (like load balancer) get serves etag from server A, and next request matched etag against server B, "none-match" might be true. The two waiters aren't talking to each other about the numbers they give out for the "special", yet it might still just be a üçî which causes re-serve of same special. Waste of food, time, energy. 

Problem: some servers will fake the "304 not modified" just so they can force the client to always send the same e-tag... Across sessions and logouts! Basically identifying the user by their cache ID. Bad. This circumvents cookies which are under users control.
